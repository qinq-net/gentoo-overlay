	<longdescription lang="en">
		A simulation, reconstruction and analysis framework that is 
		based on the ROOT system. The user can create simulated data 
		and/or perform analysis with the same framework. Geant3 and 
		Geant4 transport engines are supported, however the user code 
		that creates simulated data do not depend on a particular monte 
		carlo engine. The framework delivers base classes which enable 
		the users to construct their detectors and /or analysis tasks 
		in a simple way, it also delivers some general functionality 
		like track visualization. Moreover an interface for reading 
		magnetic field maps is also implemented.
